# Hello, my name is Logan Endes.

I am a second-year student at Rochester Institute of Technology pursuing a Bachelor's (and eventually Master's) degree in Computer Science, and I hope to soon be double majoring in Applied Japanese Language and Culture.

I am currently proficient in Python and Java, but I mainly program in Python and am in the process of learning C and SQL. 

Throughout Summer 2023, I worked as a SULI Intern at Brookhaven National Laboratory researching the use of open-source, frozen, large-language generative AI models to extract information from scientific literature to expedite the research of medical isotopes used to image and treat diseases like cancer. During my research, I used prompt engineering to compare models including Galactica, Llama-2, and Falcon in conjunction with different data filtering techniques to find what worked best at extracting accurate information from papers on isotope production.

Besides my research at Brookhaven, I plan on researching and developing an AI model to accurately score saber-fencing bouts using PyTorch, which hopefully will be usable in Spring of 2024.

Outside of that and multiple other projects I'm working on, I like to fence in my free time as well as play video games like Valorant, TFT, and Baldur's Gate 3, and I hope to get into the habit of reading more (I'm currently a few chapters into "How to Create a Mind" by Ray Kurzweil).  

In the near future, I hope to enhance my skills with PyTorch through projects and learn, at least on a fundamental level, the Rust programming language.
