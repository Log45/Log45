# Hello, my name is Logan Endes.

I am a first year student at Rochester Institute of Technology pursuing a Bachelor's (and eventually Master's) degree in Computer Science, and I hope to soon be double majoring in Applied Japanese Language and Culture.

I am currently proficient in Python and Java, but I mainly program in Python, and I am in the process of learning PyTorch to pursue machine learning and artificial intelligence.
