# Hello, my name is Logan Endes.

I am a third-year student at Rochester Institute of Technology pursuing a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science, with a minor in Applied Japanese Language and Culture.

Presently, I am working as a part-time AI Software Engineer with Ecolab focused on the applications of Computer Vision for exciting products that are entering the pilot stage.

Throughout Summer 2023, I worked as a SULI Intern at Brookhaven National Laboratory researching the use of open-source, frozen, large-language generative AI models to extract information from scientific literature to expedite the research of medical isotopes used to image and treat diseases like cancer. During my research, I used prompt engineering to compare models including Galactica, Llama-2, and Falcon in conjunction with different data filtering techniques to find what worked best at extracting accurate information from papers on isotope production.

Besides my research at Brookhaven and work at Ecolab, I plan on researching and developing an AI model to accurately score saber-fencing bouts using PyTorch.

Outside of that and multiple other projects I'm working on, I like to fence in my free time as well as play video games like Valorant, TFT, and Baldur's Gate 3, and I am beginning to build the habit of going to the gym to better my physical health.
